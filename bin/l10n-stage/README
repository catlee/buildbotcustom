The scripts

create-stage,
create-buildbot, and
botmaster

provide help in setting up and running a testing environment for how we
schedule l10n builds.

Use create-stage to create the required repos as well as one en-US and
four l10n dummy repositories. Those will already have an initial push in
the pushlog database. The repositories are in the repos directory.

Clones to work on these and to then push changes are in the workdir directory
tree. When pushing, you need to make sure that mozhghooks in 
repos/hghooks is in your PYTHONPATH.

create-buildbot sets up a master and a number of slaves for each of the
three platforms. The master is set up to have en-US dep builds, nightlies,
and l10n builds, with build properties depending on whether it's an en-US
change-triggered build, l10n triggered or nightly.

Last but not least, botmaster offers start and stop commands to start and
stop the master and all slaves.

All commands take the staging dir as argument.

After creating the hg repositories, you want to set up a 
hg serve -p 8080 --webdir-conf webdir.conf
in the staging dir, that will offer the repositories on the localhost.
Make sure to map the port here with what you specify in create-buildbot.
